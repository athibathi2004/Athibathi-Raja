## Overview  
This repository contains my solutions for the First Screening Test.  
All four problems are implemented in **Python**, kept simple and readable, with clear logic and comments where required.  
Each problem is placed in a separate file for easy review and execution.

## Problem Descriptions

### **Problem 1 – Calculator using Class**
Implemented a `Calculator` class that performs:
- Addition  
- Subtraction  
- Multiplication  
- Division  

Inputs:  
- `a`: double  
- `b`: double  
- `operation`: string (add / subtract / multiply / divide)

Focus: **Object-Oriented Programming**, constructor usage, and method-based operations.

### **Problem 2 – Generate First 'a' Odd Numbers**
Given an integer `a`, the program prints the first `a` odd numbers starting from 1.

Example:  
Input: `4` → Output: `1, 3, 5, 7`

Logic: Use a loop to generate odd numbers sequentially.

---

### **Problem 3 – Generate Odd Numbers Up to 'a'**
Given an integer `a`, generate all odd numbers **≤ a**.

Example:  
Input: `5` → Output: `1, 3, 5`  
Input: `4` → Output: `1, 3`

Logic: Use a while loop that increments odd numbers until exceeding the limit.

---

### **Problem 4 – Count Multiples of 1 to 9**
Given the list:  
`[1, 2, 8, 9, 12, 46, 76, 82, 15, 20, 30]`

Find how many numbers are divisible by digits 1–9.

Output is stored in a dictionary like:  
`{1: 11, 2: 8, 3: 4, ... }`

Logic: Nested loops → for each `i` from 1 to 9, count multiples.
